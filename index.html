			<p>Greetings! Christopher here, and you landed on this page because you want to know more about me so here it goes.  I was raised in a town called Slidell, Louisiana.  I lived there until I graduated High School and then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana where I attended Louisiana State University (Geaux Tigers!).  After 6 long years I packed everything up and moved to Denver Colorado and have not looked back.  I enjoy mountain biking, working out at the gym, and playing competitive games on my PC that I built from scratch.
